PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI:
I need to redesign the "Where to Go in January" page layout to make the calendar the primary filtering interface. Here are the specific changes:
Current State

Monthly filter buttons (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, etc.) at the top
Destination cards in a grid layout on the left
Calendar widget isolated on the right side

Desired State
1. Remove Monthly Button Filters

Eliminate the horizontal month selector buttons (Jan-Dec)
The calendar itself will become the primary date/month selection mechanism

2. Integrated Calendar-Centric Layout
Create a new layout where:

Calendar Position: Move the calendar from the right sidebar to be prominently integrated into the main content area
Layout Options (choose the most elegant):

Option A: Calendar at top center, destination cards flow below in responsive grid
Option B: Calendar left side (40% width), destination cards right side (60% width) in scrollable column
Option C: Calendar floating/sticky at top, cards wrap around it as user scrolls



3. Calendar Interaction Updates

Clicking any date in the calendar should:

Highlight that date/month
Update the heading to "Where to Go in [Selected Month]"
Filter destination cards to show only relevant destinations for that month
Update the "Best Time to Visit" recommendations based on selected date


Selected month should be visually prominent in the calendar
Consider adding date range selection capability (optional enhancement)

4. Preserve Existing Functionality

Keep all category filters (All Destinations, Romantic, Adventure, Cultural, Beach, Foodie, Nightlife)
Maintain the destination card structure with trending indicators, tags, and "Plan an experience" buttons
Keep the mini-calendar grid showing all 12 months for quick reference

5. Responsive Behavior

Mobile: Calendar should collapse to a compact month picker
Tablet: Hybrid layout with calendar above cards
Desktop: Full integrated layout as described above

Technical Considerations

Use the existing calendar component but integrate it into the main layout grid
Update state management so calendar selection triggers destination filtering
Ensure smooth transitions when switching months
Maintain the existing TypeScript/React structure

Visual Design Goals

Create a more cohesive, unified interface where the calendar feels like part of the content, not a separate widget
Reduce visual clutter by eliminating redundant month filters
Make the temporal/seasonal aspect of travel planning more intuitive and interactive
