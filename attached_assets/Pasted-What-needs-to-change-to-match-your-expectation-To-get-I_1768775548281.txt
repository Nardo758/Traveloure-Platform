What needs to change to match your expectation
To get: “I type Paris, the map centers on Paris, and the results from that destination search show around Paris”, you should:

Keep the destinationCenter flow as-is (it’s already correct and Paris will be the map center).
Stop using NYC placeholder coordinates for general services, and instead:
Use real latitude/longitude when they exist on the data you’re mapping, or
Restrict the “Travel” tab’s map to sources that already have correct coordinates (hotels, activities, custom venues, etc.), and not show fake‑located services.
Concretely, in experience-template.tsx’s mapProviders:

ts
const mapProviders = useMemo(() => {
  const serviceMarkers = filteredServices.map((<span class="hljs-params">s, index) =></span> {
    // CURRENT: fake NYC-based coordinates
    // <span class="hljs-doctag">TODO: replace lat/lng with real coordinates once available on ProviderService or external data</span>
  });

  const customVenueMarkers = (activeTab === "venue" || activeTab === "accommodations" || activeTab === "hotels")
    ? customVenues
        .filter(<span class="hljs-params">v =></span> v.latitude && v.longitude)
        .map(<span class="hljs-params">v =></span> ({
          id: `custom-<span class="hljs-subst">${v.id}`</span>,
          name: v.name,
          category: "custom-venue",
          price: Number(v.estimatedCost) || 0,
          rating: 5,
          lat: Number(v.latitude),        // already real
          lng: Number(v.longitude),       // already real
          description: v.address || v.notes || "Custom location"
        }))
    : [];

  return [...customVenueMarkers, ...serviceMarkers, ...hotelSearchMarkers, ...activitySearchMarkers];
}, [/* ... */]);

Next steps you can take (without changing server schema):

Short-term, Travel‑only fix: For the Travel experience, you can choose to:

Rely primarily on hotelSearchMarkers, activitySearchMarkers, and customVenues for the map; and
Either hide or visually de‑emphasize the legacy serviceMarkers that use fake coordinates, so the visible points are those that truly belong in/near Paris.
Longer-term, full fix:

Extend providerServices to store latitude and longitude (similar to userExperienceItems or customVenues).
Populate those from whatever upstream search/creation flow you use for providers (e.g., when a provider sets a location, or when you import from Amadeus/Viator).
Then update serviceMarkers to use those columns instead of the NYC baseline.
Once that’s done, for Travel:

Typing “Paris” + Submit:
Map centers on Paris (already true).
Markers for hotels/activities/custom venues show in/around Paris (already true where coordinates exist).
Platform provider services with real coordinates will also cluster naturally in/around Paris instead of NYC.
